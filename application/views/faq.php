				<h6><b>How do I make my profile stand out?</b></h6>
				<p>Your profile is your opportunity to tell your story in your own words. From your resume to your employment, this is your chance to shine! Below, we have some tips to help you create a profile that will help you put your best foot forward:</p><br>
				<h6><b>Profile:</b></h6>
				<p>The more complete your profile is, the easier it will be to advocate on your behalf and understand where you may be a good fit for a role. A complete profile also means fewer hoops a potential employer will need to jump through to make sure you are the right candidate.</p>
				<p>We recommend completing all fields in the "Career Preferences" section of your Profile as a starting point.</p>
				<p>Be specific. If you only want to work in Skopje, be sure to include that in your profile so we can keep an eye out for roles that might suit your specific needs.</p>

				<h6><b>Resume:</b></h6>

				<li style=" list-style-type: disc;"><span class="d-flex">Keep it short and sweet; resumes that are longer than a page or two tend to get overlooked.</span></li>

				<h6><b>How is <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>"> newface.mk </a> different?</b></h6>
				<p>We often get asked, out of all the businesses we *could* have created, why did we create a platform that helps people get jobs?</p>
				<h5>The short answer?</h5>
				<p>Because a person’s first, second, or even third job has the ability to change the entire trajectory of their career. We saw way too much talent get overlooked for opportunities because they didn’t attend the *right* school or have the *right* former title and we realized how much both candidates and companies were missing out.<p>	
				</p>So, how did we put that into practice? Simply put, newface.mk is a hiring marketplace that believes people are more than their resumes. We help people with 0-15 years of experience land jobs based on who they are, not just how they look on paper.</p>
				<p>Maybe you want to transition careers and need to parlay how your skills transfer from one industry to the next. Maybe you’re on the hunt for your first job, eager to kickstart your career. Regardless, we’ve always believed that you are more than your resume. This has been our driving force from day one and it still is today. That’s why we created a platform that shows off your talents, personalities, and potential. </p>
				<p>It’s important to note that newface.mk services both sides of the marketplace: We also help companies screen and sort talent based on abilities and potential, on top of skills and experience, because building out the right team is fundamental to your company’s future relevance and success. That’s why we’re determined to bring employers a more strategic, efficient, and data-driven approach to hiring talent.</p>
				<p>What energizes us, is the knowledge that every day we get to connect individuals to fulfilling careers that allow them to thrive. I constantly feel grateful that I get to work in an industry with the opportunity to not only drive impact at the macro level but also one where we get to make a real difference at the micro-level.
				</p>
				<p>And so now, more than ever, I’m determined to keep our platform relevant and thriving. The world needs a place that not only helps people find meaningful work but supports them throughout that process.  Newface.mk is here to ensure you are seen for who you are, not just how you look on paper. </p><br>

				<br>
				<h6><b>What experience level do I need to have to apply?</b></h6>

We occasionally get opportunistic positions on the platform in the 10-15+ range.
